corroborative circumstances tending to connect him with the

the learned English Judges in the first tea case would 
not be without relevance on the question of sentence 
in many cases of this kind. There can, I think, be no 
doubt that businessmen who are not lawyers might 
well be misled into thinking that the Ordinance and 
the Act did not intend to keep the Order of 1944 alive 
because the Order related to certain specified spices 
while the Ordinance and the Act changed the .nomen-
clature and limited themsleves to ""foodstuffs"", a term 
which, on a narrow view, would not include con-
diments and spices. However, these observations are 
not relevant here because we are not asked to restore 
either the conviction or the sentence. In view of that, 
there will be no further order and the acquittal 
will be left as it stands.",2024-10-09 09:55:18.085
