# Domain_Specific_PDF_Summarization_and_Keyword_Extraction_Pipeline
This project develops a system that automatically processes PDF documents from a folder on your computer. It generates summaries and keywords for each document, regardless of length, and stores this data in a MongoDB database, which updates after processing each file for efficient management.
